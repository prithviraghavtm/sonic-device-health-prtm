 * Input:
 *  client_id -- Name of the client Identifier

 *      Engine identifies actions against this ID
 *      to block any duplicate registrations from

 *
 * ANOMALY_INSTANCE_ID == INSTANCE_ID given to anomaly/first action in the sequence.

 *
 * ANOMALY_KEY can be used to group all anomalies reported for a specific 
 * root cause. For e.g. i/f name is the anomaly key for i/f flap.
 *
 * ANOMALY_KEY + ANOMALY_INSTANCE_ID == can track all for a single instance
 *  
 * Input:
 *  timeout -
 *      0 - No wait, return immediately with or w/o request
 *    > 0 - Max count of seconds to wait for request.
 *    < 0 - Block until a request is read
 *
 * Output:
 *  None
 *
 * Return:
 *  Non-NULL - Request read as JSON string
 *  NULL/empty string - Timeout or internal error. Use get_last_error
 *                      to get the error code.

 *  ACTION_DATA - A JSON string. The encoded JSON object is per schema of this

 *  RESULT_STR  - The human readable text translation of result-code.
